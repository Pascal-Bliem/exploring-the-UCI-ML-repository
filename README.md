# Exploring the UCI Machine Learning Repository
I'm exploring some of the less commonly used data sets in the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php). Some public data sets have gained huge popularity in introductory machine learning examples (and I see why), but c'mon, if I see the iris flowers, MNIST digits, or California housing prices one more time,  I'll throw my laptop out of the window. There are many more interesting data sets out there that are well suited for practicing machine learning and many can be found in the UCI ML repo. So in this project, I'll dig out some of these lesser known data sets to highlight different aspects of machine learning problems.

### Regression on automobile imports
In [this project](./Regression-on-automobile-imports/Automobile.ipynb) I'll do an end-to-end machine learning regression project, from data preparation over model selection to hyper-parameter tuning. We'll find out how much we should pay for imported cars!

### Ensembles for neutron stars
In [this project](./Ensembles-for-neutron-stars/Pulsars_HTRU2.ipynb) I'll see how ensemble methods such as voting classifiers, blender-layers, and random forests can be handy in classifying signals picked up by radio telescopes as interesting Pulsar neutron stars or noisy interference.

### Dimensionality reduction for colonoscopy data
In [this project](./Dimensionality-reduction-for-colonoscopy-data/Colonoscopy.ipynb) I'll employ principal component analysis to reduce the high dimensional data from colonoscopy videos as a preprocessing step for classifying gastrointestinal lesions as  malignant or benign.

### Optimized deep neural networks learning poker hands
In [this project](./Deep-learning-on-poker-hands/Deep_learning_poker_hand.ipynb) I'll set up multi-layer perceptron deep neural networks with Keras and TensorFlow to learn poker hands and optimize their hyper-parameters with the hyperas/hyperopt package.
